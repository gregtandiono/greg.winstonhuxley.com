##I am my Worse Client
####So we bitch about clients left and right, but after treating yourself like a client, you change.

***

**“I am Jack’s worse client”**

I don’t know if this applies to everyone, but, heck, I felt like I was the worse client. It took me 3 years to make up my mind about my own brand identity as a freelancer; it took me a year and a half to decide what kind of website I want for myself. Even after I completed my first site, I keep changing my mind, and worse, I changed my brand look over and over again.

*Am I indecisive? Most likely.*

*Do I want things perfect for myself, because I possess the tools, skills, knowledge, design eye? Absolutely.*

*Do you sell yourself to clients, employers about the tools, skills, knowledge and design eye you possess? Absolutely.*

*Do I expect to build myself the ultimate, super-amaze-balls site, design, because I know I can? Of course I will.*

*Do the people that hire you expect the same? Yes.*

It’s not the same is it? How you treat yourself and how you treat your clients? What’s worse about treating yourself as the client is that you expect so much, and you constantly think you can do better than what you have already done.

“Nothing is ever going to be good enough!” You think to yourself.

“Nothing is ever going to be good enough for this client! GOD!” How I think about clients, sometimes.

It was a schizophrenic journey (philosophically speaking), but the outcome was simply:

I became more understanding of my clients/employer’s needs. I rarely complain about how they think, because I know myself if I were a client. I felt like I was the worse person in the world, but I fixed myself, understanding that inner-client personality.

Here’s the exercise:

1. Take a vacation from yourself, and think of yourself as an entrepreneur who owns a chain of restaurants and in need of a website/branding/design/etc.
2. Write down a brief on how you want your branding/website/design/etc on a piece of paper; give a brief, quirky explanation on how you want it to look like, be whimsical. Don’t forget to set a deadline!
3. Put it on your Iphone Calendar or any reminder, set it to remind you in a week or two.
4. Now get your developer/designer mode on, prior to the brief.
5. and try to follow the brief as best as you can.
6. Evaluate your work and compare it with your other client work.
7. Was it consistent? Was it procrastinated? Was it way off?

- Cheers!
