##Self-Taught Developer
***
I am, currently, the lead developer and Co-Founder of [Winston Huxley](http://www.winstonhuxley.com). I lead the creative process in a variety of disciplines: Web Development, Web App Development, Branding, Design, and fluency in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node js, PHP. I lead a small collective of Marketers, Social Media Experts, Developers, Graphic Designers, Content Strategist, and Copywriters.


Originally from crowded, hot Jakarta, Indonesia, I moved to Atlanta, GA to study Music at Georgia State University (GSU) where I received a 2 year degree. Rummaged through a few odd jobs, until I worked in a print studio [Alvin Diec Studio Inc](http://www.alvindiec.com),	and designed posters for local venues and local ad banners.

Then I went back to Jakarta, Indonesia, where I studied Journalism at [Universitas Pelita Harapan](http://www.uph.edu/) and received a bachelor of journalism. During the course of 3 years, I learned how to develop websites by learning via tutorials after tutorials.

Now, I'm in Vancouver, freelancing, then found a couple of people I work closely with for certain projects.

###I am currently looking for an agency/start-up experience at the moment.
