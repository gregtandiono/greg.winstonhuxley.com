<h4>Being Bullied can be a positive thing</h4>
<hr>
<p><strong>EARLY LIFE BULLY (Jakarta, Indonesia)</strong></p>
<p>I have been bullied pretty much throughout primary school and all the way to highschool; I come home everyday and asked my parents, “Why do they always pick on me?” Growing up in a third world country was pretty tough for me, and especially when people think you’re a little different, they completely alienate you, mock you from a distance, or worse, physical intimidation. Sometimes I would fight back, but it got me no where, and it just got worse. My parents had always told me never to fight back, “Don’t descend to their level! You’re not that type of person!” Sure, I agreed. Got good grades, ignored everything else around me and got myself into college, straight out of high school. Done.</p>
<p><strong>COLLEGE LIFE BULLY (Atlanta, Georgia)</strong></p>
<p>College life was wonderful for me, I got along with everyone, I thought life couldn’t get any better than this. 3 semesters in, I have finally encountered a group of pretentious people. They were intellectually much more superior than me, I wanted to learn from them, I wanted to get to know them, but however, I wasn’t good enough to even be seen with them. So, intellectual bullying. Sure. Got the message. Got my shit together, motivated myself, and promised myself I would never be that type of person. Never once heard from them again, though I still wish them all the best.</p>
<p><strong>WORK PLACE BULLY (Atlanta, Georgia)</strong></p>
<p>Fresh out of college, got my degree in music. Life was good, but finding a job was…. well…. yeah…. Joined an orchestra group, for no money, eating ramen noodles 3 days a week, and eating rice with eggs and sriracha hot sauce for the rest of the week. Life was Diarrhea. My bank account went to a minus because of the darned monthly charge. Life was Explosive Diarrhea. Got a job doing photoshop work (with no fucking clue how to use photoshop, but learned quickly) for $8/hour BEFORE TAXES! But, oh well, my life was to pay rent and drink. A guy in my office, who was an accountant, whom took a liking in design bossed me around and treated me like a mouse (click click click); then took my work and said it was his. But, hey, I didn’t mind being a mouse, rather than being a homeless, hungry mouse. 5 months in. Gave a huge ‘fuck you’ to the guy, walked out of the door, walking tall. And since then, learned photoshop, became a photoshop jockey, became a web designer, now a full-on back-end developer.</p>
<p>I really have to track this guy down and give him a hug.</p>
<p><strong>RESULTS: LATER IN LIFE (Vancouver, BC. Present Day)</strong></p>
<p>Working in a tech industry, love my job, love my life, counting my lucky stars that I’m alive and well. Imagine if I had spent time contemplating revenge, fueled by hatred from constantly being bullied throughout their lives; and I know a lot of people that are like that. All they do is talk about how much they hate their bosses, how much they hate their jobs, how much they hate being bullied by life in general. I’m not saying I don’t complain, I do complain, numerous times, but I keep it to myself, and I keep myself in check. If I complain about the shit that’s going on in my life 24/7 and laying it on people’s ears, then maybe there’s something wrong with me. Being bullied is like being given a responsibility and opportunity to shape your character. I’m still currently being bullied by my environment: taxes, bills, rent, crackheads, etc. etc. But I just choose to not let these things bother me, its a responsibility, and I deal with it. If I had taken the road of punching every person who crosses me in the past, then I probably wouldn’t deal with problems calmly. Life is good again.</p>
