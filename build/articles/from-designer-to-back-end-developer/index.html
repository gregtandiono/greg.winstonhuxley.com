<h4>The journey of a photoshop slicer for the web who became a back-end developer</h4>
<hr>
<p>In 2008, I was a photoshop jocky, slicing static images, forking them over to Dreamweaver and magically transform those awesome images into a web page ! …….. then 30 minutes later, you realized that the amount of hours you put in making a beautiful photoshop mockup just doubled, because you had to fix problems and discover things you didn’t know about publishing for the web. Another scenario, in my case, after being all “cool” with your client, and he/she is floating in the heavens because they’re in LOVE with the mockup; you realize the things we design/drafted (wild, flashy ideas) on how the site will look like just does not seem “RATIONAL” or worse… you just don’t know how to execute it. You enslave yourself on google for decades trying to figure your super awesome idea that you pitched to your client, with luck and dilligence , you may be able to pull it off at the cost of NOT sleeping and making LESS money for the amount of hours you put in. I thought to myself “holy crap! am I in a pickle now!”</p>
<p>So I took some initiative to take some time and dedicate myself to learn the tools that are available out there to make your life EASIER as a web designer. Then you come across all these alien languages: php, mysql, noSql, mongodb, Node.js, .NET, ruby, ruby on rails, responsive design, adaptive, fluid, UX, etc. etc. That’s when I felt like the smallest person in the world, because I was ignorant back then, I didn’t even come from a design background or any technical related background at all, I though knowing photoshop was it (stupid me).</p>
<p>Months later after taking some time off and just glued myself on the computer screen, learning and learning all these things, I decided that I was ready to take on some projects, because I was more confident…… or so I thought….. So I took a job in an agency, and again, my face resembled that of a blow-up doll. Using a version control for the very first time…. completely clueless… and people actually gave me a look for using Dreamweaver as a text-editor (they had very good reasons for it though, they didn’t hate the product, they just thought that it wasn’t very efficient). Working for the very first time in a real dev environment really pushed me to get better, and encouraged me NEVER stop learning.</p>
<p>Some time later during the year, I gained so much knowledge in PHP, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, that I became a semi-back-end-developer, but at the same time still possess the front-end “eye”. I didn’t expect to be in that position. I thought to myself “Wow, I’m a Rails Developer! I’m awesome!” ….. or so I thought. Truth to be told, Rails kicked my arse hard, but loved every moment of it and I thought Rails was it for me, it was the best thing that ever happened to me… WRONG!</p>
<p>Years has passed, I have more white hair, got a bit wiser, learned a lot more things, writing clean markups, creating web applications, managing databases; I thought to myself, “I think I’m ok now.”</p>
<p>As of this moment, I can honestly say that I am a Node developer, a Rails Developer, a Web Product Developer, and a UX engineer. I have matured, gained so much knowledge with the help of Google and colleagues of mine (tip my hat to Luke Vivier, Lorne Markham, Dylan Elash, Adwin Lui, Tanner Charles, Sandro Federico)</p>
<p>The intention of writing this article is not to discourage designers out there; in a lot of cases, we do need a dedicated designers to make usable wireframes, great mockups, produce great assets; but rather encourage them to learn as they go, I’m not saying that every Front-End Developer should go through this pilgrimage; it was one hell of a journey for me, a lot of struggle for me, but I had a blast, and I don’t stop learning, ever.</p>
